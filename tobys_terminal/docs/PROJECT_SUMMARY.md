# Toby's Terminal Project Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Toby's Terminal project, including recent enhancements, structure, and next steps.

## Project Structure

Toby's Terminal is a billing and management system with two main components:

1. **Desktop Application**: A tkinter-based GUI application for managing orders, customers, and billing
2. **Web Application**: A Flask-based web interface for accessing the system remotely

The project uses SQLite for data storage and includes various modules for handling different aspects of the business operations.

## Recent Enhancements

### 1. New Printavo Sync System

A comprehensive system for synchronizing data from Printavo has been implemented, replacing the old separate import buttons:

- **Core Functionality**: `tobys_terminal/shared/printavo_sync.py`
- **Updated Interface**: `tobys_terminal/desktop/main_updated.py`
- **Documentation**: `docs/printavo_sync.md`
- **Testing**: `test_printavo_sync.py`

### 2. Enhanced Roster Views

The roster views for IMM and Harlestons have been enhanced with:

- Inline editing for all fields
- Calendar widgets on date fields
- Order entry that matches imported orders with existing ones using PO numbers
- Integration with the new printavo_sync.py system

Files:
- `tobys_terminal/desktop/gui/imm_roster_view_enhanced.py`
- `tobys_terminal/desktop/gui/harlestons_roster_view_enhanced.py`
- `update_roster_views.py` (helper script for updating)

### 3. Improved Documentation

New documentation has been added to help with deployment, testing, and understanding the system:

- `docs/installation_guide.md`: Guide for installing the application
- `docs/printavo_sync.md`: Documentation for the new sync system
- `docs/testing_guide.md`: Guide for testing the application
- `docs/deployment_guide.md`: Guide for deploying the application

### 4. CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions workflow has been set up for continuous integration and deployment:

- `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`: Workflow configuration for automated testing and linting

### 5. Test Suite

Sample tests have been added to demonstrate how to write tests for the application:

- `tobys_terminal/shared/tests/test_printavo_sync.py`: Tests for the new sync functionality

## Installation and Deployment

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tobys-terminal.git
   cd tobys-terminal
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```
   TOBYS_TERMINAL_DB=path/to/your/terminal.db
   ```

4. Install the package:

   python test_printavo_sync.py --mode check
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Create a GitHub repository (if you don't have one already)
2. Push the code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/tobys-terminal.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Set up automated testing with GitHub Actions
