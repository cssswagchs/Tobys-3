# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for creating a GitHub repository and pushing your Toby's Terminal code to it.

## 1. Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.
2. Verify your email address.

## 2. Create a New Repository

1. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of GitHub and select "New repository".
2. Enter a repository name (e.g., "tobys-terminal").
3. Add a description (optional): "A comprehensive billing and management system for CSS".
4. Choose whether the repository should be public or private.
   - **Public**: Anyone can see the repository, but you control who can commit.
   - **Private**: You choose who can see and commit to the repository.
5. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files).
6. Click "Create repository".

## 3. Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, you'll see instructions for pushing an existing repository. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/tobys_terminal_clean
   ```

3. Add the remote repository URL:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/cssswagchs/tobys-terminal.git
   ```
   (Replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username and "tobys-terminal" with your repository name)

4. Rename the default branch to main (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   ```

5. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

6. Enter your GitHub username and password when prompted.
   - If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password.
   - To create a personal access token, go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token.
   - Select the "repo" scope and any other permissions you need.

## 4. Verify Your Repository

1. Go to your GitHub profile.
2. Click on the "Repositories" tab.
3. Click on your new repository.
4. Ensure all files have been uploaded correctly.
5. Check that the README.md is displayed on the repository homepage.

## 5. GitHub Actions

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`) that will automatically run tests and linting when you push changes to the repository.

To view the workflow:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Actions" tab.
3. You should see the workflow running or completed.

## 6. Clone the Repository on Other Computers

To use the repository on another computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tobys-terminal.git
cd tobys-terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## 7. Making Changes

When you make changes to the code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "imm terminal fix"
git push
```

## 8. Getting Updates

If you make changes on another computer or if someone else contributes to the repository, you can get the latest changes:

```bash
git pull
```
